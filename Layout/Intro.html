<p margin="50">"Direga" is the <a target="_self" href="/Left Menu/Culture/Qinen.html">Qinen</a> word formed from the root "direroi," or "to guard, to keep," and the suffix "-ga," signifying an active nominalization: a transformation of the modified word to mean something close to "keeping" in the sense that what is kept has been kept, with care, for a long time. In a word, it means "history," but more broadly than what we mean when we say "history" in English. Direga is history, but it is also everything else about the world which may be preserved. It is science, it is technology, it is culture--and, on the island of <a target="_self" href="/Left Menu/Geography/main.html">Terane</a>, it is <a target="_self" ="/Left Menu/Demons/main.html">demons</a>, it is <a target="_self" href="/Left Menu/Wildlife/Fairies.html">fairies</a>, it is <a target="_self" href="/Left Menu/Souls/main.html">souls</a>.</p>
 
<p margin="50">This is the permanently-work-in-progress record of a fantasy world created for use in a table-top role-playing game, whose events will be recorded alongside the lore. The left menu will contain information about the world, where the right menu will contain information about and recaps of the story as it is played. The hope is, through the upkeep of this site, to create a cohesive hyperfiction and preserve the exploits of my characters and the players'. The buttons on either side will take you to collections of pages; the header on each will bring you back to the parent page.

<p margin="50">The <a target="_self" href="/Layout/glossary.html">glossary</a> contains brief definitions of what I feel to be the most integral facets of Terane.</p>

<p margin="50">The following is an overly-dissective discussion On the Nature of Worldbuilding and my philosophy on constructing Terane. If you are not interested, do not read it.</p>

<p margin="50">The exercise of imagining a world is inherently narcissistic; it implies the imaginer has some amount of “right” to do so. I do think I have the “right” to invent characters to populate a world, and invent a language for those people to have spoken, and invent a history acted out by dead characters to serve as a context for living characters and their actions. However, I do not think I have the “right” to inform you on the physical explanation of Terane’s sun, nor the actual language spoken by people in Terane right now, nor the political history of pre-Demonic society. To some extent, those rights are conferred on me by ability and desire; I have no right to elaborate on the taxonomy of ivory snakes because I have no idea about any actual theory of taxonomy, and I have no right to discuss the specifics of Safian Kanamen’s plan for urban reform because I find that incredibly boring—but I do have the right to deeply investigate the conflicting ideologies at play in modern scientific Asiine because that stuff is a) generated from stuff I already know a lot about (i.e. stuff I invented) and b) intensely interesting to me. Whether or not I do any of this well is separate from my right to do so, even though both phenomena seem to come from the same source. The difference lies in a hidden, third factor which I like to call the “degree of accepted [nominalization of metaphorical].”</p>

<p margin="50">Here’s a line of thought:<br>
A world made by a person is not complete—there always exist some parts of it which must be left up to the imagination;<br>
What is imagined is metaphorical—“imagination” is a human trait used to abstract and reform the world around us to better understand it;
Therefore, worlds are metaphors (to differing extents).</p>

<p margin="50">Of course, the truth of that conclusion rests directly on the truth of the two premises. In this case the premises are derived from other composite pseudosyllogisms:</p>

<p margin="50">A thing can never be “complete”—you can always add something else; people make things; therefore a thing made by a person is not complete; a world is a thing; therefore a world made by a person is not complete.<br>
Things only imagined do not, actually, exist; things nonexistent are instead metaphorical; therefore what is imagined is metaphorical.</p>

<p margin="50">I am no logician, but I do seriously believe in the line of thought I proposed to arise from these premises. Terane is constructed from the ground up with the concession in mind that, in the end, it exists as a metaphor. I intend fully to use it as such during Splinters/SQARLATTI to explore several themes which would be difficult to explore without such a nice allegorical device. Much of my interest in that idea of mine comes from my love for the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender and its ability to use its magic and fantasy to explore serious themes especially of positive masculinity (in Iroh’s teachings to Zuko contrasted with his warmongering history) and virtuous self-control (Azula’s struggle with and descent into madness). To that end, all the components of Terane reflect my ideology—be it a perfect mapping, an ironic inversion, or something in between—and their aggregate forms something close to my opinion on several subjects I believe to be central to myself as a person. I truly embrace my narcissism here.</p>

<p margin="50">If you care anything about authorial intent, I’ll give you my intended themes for free: how acceptable is it for purpose to be ascribed?; what informs objective identity/is there even such a thing?; can a thing totally lose its identity?; does perversity prevent its own defeat?; where do rationality and emotional reasoning intersect?; to what degree is increased security worth decreased agency?; what is the role of the individual part of a system? These questions overlap and are interpreted mostly within aesthetic bounds, because I consider myself an artist before anything else. But in the course of answering them I will present mechanics, characters, and scenarios which treat them more politically than anything else, I think, because that manner is simply more conducive to tabletop roleplay than is discussion of aesthetics.</p>

<p margin="50">So, the answer to “how on Earth do people end up speaking anything close to English and/or French when Qinen is so different from both” is “people on Terane do not speak English and they do not speak French, but pretending like they do allows me to focus on the parts of the world more directly related to my precious themes.” People play a game strikingly similar to chess and say “checkmate” not because of dimension-warping madness leading to cross-pollination of ideas between worlds, but because I don’t care enough to develop an analogous ancient Persian culture from which to derive “šāh māt” to mean “the king is dead” and corrupt its pronunciation through thousands of years to arrive at a contemporary custom. People say “checkmate” because I am not qualified to develop a sufficiently-realistic linguistic history, because I do not care enough to learn how, and, most crucially, because a deep and consistent enough Qinen-based etymology which believably yields another word to mean “checkmate” answers none of my thematic questions (nor does it predictably lead toward any answers). I put things in Terane expressly to serve that narcissistic purpose.</p>

<p margin="50">Also, I want Terane to be cool. I include a lot of things just because they strike my interest and/or make me happy. At the end of the day, if I’m not having fun, I won’t keep building the metaphor.</p>
