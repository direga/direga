<p margin="50">Demons in Terane are invisible, intangible, infinitely-powerful beings. They determine and enforce all natural laws; time and space are demonic phenomena. A demon is known by what it does, because there is no other way to define it. Demons which drive engines are engine demons, demons which control lamps are lamp demons, and demons which tell time are clock demons. In truth, the demon is a theoretical construct, useful for explaining the <a href="/Left Menu/Prewar History/Day of Blessing.html">gift</a> granted humanity by <a href="/Left Menu/Prewar History/Legendary Figures/Siti Tsen.html">Siti Tsen</a>.</p>

<p margin="50">The harnessing of such powerful forces is not without risk; the <a href="/Left Menu/Culture/Mtera.html">Mtera</a> of the demon is simply defined as the desire to utterly annihilate the <a href="/Left Menu/Intertransience/Material.html">Material</a>. If a demon is allowed a hair of freedom, it will destroy the hair instantly. Therefore, safety regulations severely restricted the ability of even knowledgeable demonologists to summon them. No one person ever had the process for the complete ritual, for example, and those that knew even part of it were effecively forbidden from writing demonic instructions of their own.</p>
