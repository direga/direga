<p margin="50">QINE AND THE ABAREN<br>
In the geographically and politically central city of Qine (CHEE-nay; lit. "place of exchange"), there was organized an "Abaren" (AH-buh-ren; lit. "uniter") of the politically elite. The Abaren acted as a republic council which was capable of overriding the largely authoritarian decisions made by the heads of the river cities, with a few exceptions: the Abaren could not declare authority on issues relating to demonic safety or ordain the summoning of demons, and the Abaren could not pass meta-governmental legislation which would override the structure of river-city governments (e.g. the Abaren could not crown a queen of Mitsesiibune, or fire her secretary, or tell her how she should appoint his replacement). Anything else--land redistribution in minor provinces, tax collection and enforcement policies, demands for the diversion of resources to certain tasks, etc.--was very much in the hands of the hundred-or-so seats on the Abaren. In particular, their task was to a.) ensure peace between river cities, b.) designate military leaders to handle monstrous threats, c.) pass policy reflecting the desires and well-being of the common folk of Terane, and d.) continue their own existence. By the early dawn of the fourteenth century after the arrival of the Great Demons, they had failed on every count.</p>

<p margin="50">Qine itself, with a population of roughly 5000, was not an industrial or commercial city by any means. It almost exclusively housed members of a political class, many of which held seats on the Abaren; in order to claim such a seat—meaning, in order to run for office—the claimant’s presence on Qine soil was mandatory. Weapons were strictly forbidden, as were active weapon-users; generals, soldiers, and mages, unless retired, could not pass the (very symbolic [i.e. nonexistent]) walls of Qine. The heads of river cities could not enter the city either. A few exceptions: an active militarist could enter if granted a People’s Blessing by the Abaren, reflecting a great feat of public safety such as the eradication of a monster den or a particularly bad monster; the head of a river city could enter Qine, and was mandated to do so, during a cerimonious celebration of the Day of Blessing--attended by the Great Demons as well. It was vastly preferable for members of a demonic dynasty to serve at their own river city, for reasons of status and power, but often those far down the line of succession were sent to (or sent themselves to) Qine in order to represent the family interests.</p>

<p margin="50">ELECTIONS<br>
Every year a primary election was held. It was presided over by the “Oen” (OH-wen; lit. "doers/makers") of the previous year, either or both of which could, upon the conclusion of the vote, perform a Final Appeal to the Great Demons. If all four (excluding Uako) unanimously agreed to answer the appeal, the outcome of the vote would be overturned and Qine would be suspended for as long as the Great Demons saw fit; The Great Demons would then reevaluate and restructure the entire government system. This was a safeguard if the Abaren ever failed in any of its four aforementioned tasks. At the election itself, two Oen, ten Kesiiqin (KEH-shee-cheen; lit. "speakers for the people"), fifteen Kon (CORN without the "R;" lit. "heart-ers"), and a technically-unlimited amount of Ten (lit. "breathers") won office from the votes of a physically-present collection, usually more than ten thousand people (including most of the population of Qine). The responsibilities of each office of the Abaren are as follow:</p>

<p margin="50">OEN<br>
Besides the already-mentioned responsibility to preside over the next election and the right to declare a Final Appeal, the two Oen generally oversaw each meeting of the Abaren and held the most individual power among its members. They typically served as figureheads for their movements, with an effective Oen rallying a large amount of other officials behind them even before assuming office. Only after serving as Ten for over ten years or having completed two terms in a higher office was an official permitted to run for the office of Oen. Before each election, the Abaren agreed on a reward for the incoming pair after they completed their term. Traditionally, this came in the form of a comfortable position in the upper government of a minor province, which the Oen was duty-bound to accept. After having served as Oen, an official was disallowed from running for that same office until [X] years had passed; most former Oen usually retired from politics anyway, at least temporarily, since the prestige from the title far outlived its actual term--even outside Qine.</p>

<p margin="50">QIN<br>
The "speakers of the people" (shortened from Kesiiqin to Qin, lit. "speaker") were named as such because the requirements of the office demanded each would-be speaker hail from outside Qine, hold no claim to royal lineage, and, most chiefly, be elected by a group of people exhibiting those same two qualities. They had the unique ability to veto any action of the Oen, though there was a complicated, unwritten set of "rules" delineating under which circumstances a veto was "acceptable," and under which circumstances it was career suicide. Roughly, artful application of the veto no more than three or four times a year was deemed appropriate, while flagrant abuse of the veto, such as to deny Final Appeals, was liable to make more enemies than friends. A speaker’s term was two years, after which they could be reelected instantly. Within the Kesiiqin, an Akesiiqin was nominated, who enjoyed a greater freedom of "acceptable" vetos and reserved the right to appoint an emergency replacement Kesiiqin without an election.</p>

<p margin="50">KON<br>
The office typically held by retired military personnel, that of Kon, was able to declare two separate forms of martial law: the first granted the 15-strong Konship the right to inarguably appoint a particular militarist to lead a campaign against some threat; and the second, called the Central Rule, conferred upon the Oen the right to mobilize a military to occupy Qine or any other provincial territory, and bypass the Kon in all military matters. Technically, the office of Kon was held for life, but voters every year elected one Kon to step down and one to fill the void. The office was often resigned as well (when temporarily-retired militarists took to the field again), leaving more seats open.</p>

<p margin="50">TEN<br>
The Ten were the meat of the Abaren, making up a good 75-85% of the seats. They had very limited power but could make their opinion known by proposing legislature and/or voting. There was no term limit for Tenship once elected; however, would-be Ten were required to meet a certain absolute threshold of voters on election day, which may have been be difficult considering each citizen voted only once for each office. Generally, the amount of Ten increased by 5-10 each year, accounting for those that stepped down. Every tenth election contained a Judgement (the Abaren could also call for a Judgement at any point), where every voter had the option of taking an additional ballot consisting of the names of every sitting Ten and marking whether they believed the Ten to deserve continued office. And so were several dozen Ten purged every decade, maintaining an equilibrium. Those stripped of office in this manner could run again, but the status of "unjustified Ten" stuck for life--and showed up on the ballot.</p>
