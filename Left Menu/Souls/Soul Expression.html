<p margin="50">Soul expression occurs whenever a soul exists; if there is a soul, it is expressing. However, what is normally meant by "soul expression" is a conscious expenditure of soul to affect something outside oneself. In other words, it is the ability to alter the physical world, the Material, with sheer force of will. At the highest level achievable by most, an apple-sized object could be created and maintained for several minutes. Matter can only be replaced, not destroyed, with expression, so an effort to damage something would be interpreted as the desire to express an air pocket, for example, in place of an object. And, always, the expression is impermanent. If a soul is not constantly feeding its own self into an expression, it fizzles. Expression imposes an exacting toll; it is extraordinarily difficult for an untrained soul to create just a flash of a speck of dust without an enormous effort.</p>

<p margin="50">Even training, however, may not suffice. The strength of a soul has a maximum bound called its "limit." When below its limit, the soul recuperates quickly, and when at its limit, the soul gradually swells at a rate determined by how much it has been weathered previously; the degree to which the soul is able to carry momentum to and through its limit is called its "elasticity."</p>

<p margin="50">The usual analogy given to explain elasticity is of a solid, rubber ball which represents the soul’s strength contained within a balloon which represents the soul’s limit. Normally, the balloon and ball rest at equal sizes. Expending some soul results in the ball shrinking, while the balloon remains constant, albeit floppy. The ball increases in size at a rate which accelerates so long as it meets no resistance; so, if it decreases until it is mere millimeters smaller than the balloon, it will only grow slowly until striking its bound. But if it is near-nonexistent, the moment it expands to match the balloon will be at a relatively great speed. Now, since the ball is at a default state of expansion, it gradually stretches the balloon, with diminishing returns (because its expansion is based on resistance). But if the soul slingshots its expansion--draws it back and releases--the ball is able to carry its momentum as it reaches the "limit" and stretch it further. Elasticity is how easy it is to achieve this "slingshot" effect; that is, how much the soul can recoil the limit as it regenerates.</p>

<p margin="50">A soul with a great strength has a high limit: a large initial balloon. But a "weaker" soul with a greater elasticity may well overcome that competitor, given time to reduce and expand, reduce and expand; therefore is elasticity the measure of a soul's potential, of its ultimate strength.</p>

<p margin="50">In practice, a soul’s strength is never at its maximum, since a soul must expend enough energy at all times to maintain its domain. But if a soul has enough strength, typically as a result of its elasticity, the proportion of strength required to sustain the vessel becomes negligible so that a soul at its effective (as opposed to theoretical) limit actually does begin to push at its bounds. This is what separates "magic"-capable souls from the mundane: the former has the requisite elasticity to become strong enough to even gain strength, while the latter has such a low elasticity and base strength that it can never hope to push its limit, doomed forever to languish at an effective maximum without the means to produce enough momentum.</p>

<p margin="50">Here an analogy of a slingshot may be more intuitive than the ball model. The length of the slingshot’s band represents the strength, while its tautness represents the elasticity. "Caster" souls are able to fire pellets 50 paces away, while mundane souls will fall short. If tautness is high and length is high, the band can be pulled back a great distance and will send its pellet careening: a clear "caster." If tautness is low, but length is adequately high, the slingshot may not be as efficient, but because it can be stretched a great distance, it may still be able to clear the mark. Similarly, a short band with a lot of tautness to make up for it could possibly fire far enough, if only because exercising it over and over may eventually expand the band to allow it more pullback. However, a band which is both short and limp is trapped in the cyclic doom of inadequacy to even become adequate: a mundane soul.</p>

<p margin="50">So, some souls can become great expressors, and some will forever fail. Elasticity is commonly held to be genetic, since there is no known way to improve it. But even among the powerful, there is a mark which sets the greatest souls from the rest: the potency for the expression of Akura, or "pure expression."</p>

<p margin="50">An intense and practiced focus of the soul allows those at a certain strength to sustain an impenetrable, unbreakable material at a much higher cost. All Akura shards are so expressed in precisely the same crystallization every time, even between expressors. It is a fundamental pattern which requires great effort to subvert. For this reason, and because demons, for some unknown reason, do not desire the destruction of Akura, that Akura serves as the material for a <a href="/Left Menu/Demons/Metademons/Sigil">sigil capstone</p>.
