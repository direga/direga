<p margin="50">The soul is the fundamental unit of sapience on the <a href="/Left Menu/Intertransience/Material.html">Material Plane</a>; that is, if a thing has a soul, it has free will and wisdom, and if a thing is free and wise, it has a soul. Its definition on the <a href="/Left Menu/Intertransience/Soul.html">Soul Plane</a> is more complicated and less understood. The leading theory proposes a "Soul Mass," a maelstrom, so to speak, within the plane which hemorrhages souls as needed for <a href="/Left Menu/Intertransience/main.html">intertransience</a>. However, this is a highly theoretical discussion. More immediately useful information concerns how the people of Terane use their souls to persist on the Material and affect others on it.</p>

<p margin="50">What is called the "domain" of the soul is, in brief, whatever has those properties of freedom and wisdom. So, your body is one domain, your friend's is another, and a <a href="/Left Menu/Wildlife/Fauna.html">blossom sprite</a>'s is yet another. It is trivial for a soul to influence its own domain, so much so that most people do not consciously ascribe their movements, their breaths, their heartbeat, to their soul. A soul expends a tiny amount of energy acting within its own domain, but can expend much more for a dramatically lesser effect in a domainless space of the Material, and much much more for a nearly negligible effect in another domain on the Material. All these things are called <a target="main" href="/Left Menu/Souls/Soul Expression.html">soul expression</a>, but the term is usually reserved for defining domainless alterations.

<p margin="50">The <a href="/Left Menu/Culture/Mtera.html">Mtera</a> of the soul is the essential existential question of Terane: what is the desire of the soul? No consensus has been reached, but candidate components have been found which help understand the soul. The first principle is  self-preservation. In plain speech, it is that the soul will, above all else, defend its own existence, which means defending its domain: the human body. Therefore, when you bleed, it is your soul which clots it. When your bone breaks, it is your soul which realigns it. When you suffer brain damage, it is your soul which is the most damaged of all. People on Terane with strong souls will heal noticeably faster than those with weak souls.<br>The second principle is resistance: a soul which is being affected by an alien stimulus will do anything in its power to reject its influence. This propoerty is your natural defense against mind-altering abilities such as <a target="main" href="/Left Menu/Souls/Soul Invasion.html">soul invasion</a>, and it is the spirit's instinctive desire for freedom from whatever may chain it. Some claim the first and second principles of the soul are synonymous; because wounds to the body are, in a very literal sense, an imposition on the soul's freedom, resistance is merely a symptom of self-preservation. This perspective is not wrong, though there is much debate over the most useful model of thought.<br>The third, and final non-controversial principle is propogation: a soul wants to grow and become stronger. This can mean literal increase in power, or it can mean satisfaction of a legacy through birthing another soul from itself, or it can mean subjugation of other souls with its own power. Again, it is possible to think of propogation as another facet of self-preservation, but this requires a more pessimistic outlook, interpreting the world as a constant, violent infliction against the freedom of the soul, to which aggrandizement is the only response.</p>

<p margin="50">It is important to understand that what you might call "magic" is, more likely than not, the effect of an understood and intentionally-focused phenomenon of the soul, <a href="/Left Menu/Wildlife/Fairies.html">fairy</a>, or <a href="/Left Menu/Demons/Metademons/Sigil.html">demon</a>. The "Arts" of the soul in particular refer to the following abilities and concequences:</p>
