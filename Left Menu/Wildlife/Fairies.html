<p margin="50">Fairies, soulless beings neither flora nor fauna, share many properties with <a href="/Left Menu/Demons/main.html">demons</a>: they are invisible, and only felt, not seen. Typically they manifest as derangements of the soul, potentially giving rise to <a href="/Left Menu/Souls/Soul Aberration.html">aberrations</a>, though normally the being they parasite suffers at most negligible damage to their <a href="/Left Menu/Souls/Soul Expression.html">expressive</a> capacity. Instead, the primary danger of the fairy is the damage it inflicts on the mental domain of the soul. The <a href="/Left Menu/Culture/Mtera.html">Mtera</a> of the fairy, as far as it is understood, is to cause delusions relating to a failure to correctly recognize, delineate, and/or identify oneself or others--delusions which tend to be contaigous. In plain terms, the fairy is a creature borne of madness.</p>

<p margin="50">Many philosophers have taken fairies into account when describing the <a href="/Left Menu/Souls/Main.html">Mtera of the soul</a>. It is clear that the soul's resistance to fairies demonstrates a self-preservative instinct, but a more controversial perspective views fairies as a fourth element in the cycle of Mtera, a check on the ostentibly powerful souls: fairies alter the proposition component of the soul's Mtera to weaken it, meaning the power of the soul is linked to how clearly it understands the world, which would imply the component of "truth," of the ability to see an objective reality. It is no accident that this is a hallmark of <a href="/Left Menu/Demons/Post-Demonism.html">Post-Demonism</a>, considering its most vocal proponent is <a href="/Left Menu/Modern History/Modern Figures/Fiyoriyo Kuboiko.html">Fiyoriya Kuboiko</a>.

<p margin="50">FÉE INUSITÉE<br>The first fairy to be described, by <a href="/Left Menu/Geography/Zhamayne.html">Zhamayne</a> scholars. Literally translated as "rarely-used fairy," la fée inusitée was originally meant to class every fairy as one, but its definition when applied to a single species has been restricted as a more varied collection was revealed. Some texts still use the name as a catch-all instead of "fairy," however. Nowadays, in the age of <a href="/Left Menu/Postwar History/Modern Science.html">modern science</a>, nearly all information on la fée inusitée is lost or remains in the hands of Zhamayne scholars, and what little is known changes depending on the person asked or the tale told.</p>
