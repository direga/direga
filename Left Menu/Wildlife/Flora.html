<p margin="50">Plants in Terane come in many varieties: mundane and magical, docile and dangerous, sacred and sacreligious. The most interesting among them are merited a description here, but this is by no means an exhaustive list. An average island-dweller would have trouble coming up with all this information on the spot, but would probably be able to recognize most of the names.</p>

<p margin="50">BARBED SPIDERS<br>The gangly limbs of the Barbed Spider protrude radially from a flexible trunk, forming a loose dome. Each “leg” sheds several hundred tiny needles (“hairs”) per minute as new ones emerge from the greasy growths. It is particularly dangerous to be near forests of these trees during <a href="/Left Menu/Geography/Night Winds.html">night winds</a>, when barb storms fling the hairs in dense enough sheets so as to be lethal. Black crunchy blankets made of the barbs have, in the neglect caused by the end of the <a href="/Left Menu/Wartime History/main.html">Demon War</a>, spread like a corruption, leaving large portions of Terane <a href="/Left Menu/Geography/Maps.html">uninhabitable</a>. 

<p margin="50">THE BLACK MAPLE<br>Only one of these trees exists on Terane, in the southwest corner on the border of <a href="/Left Menu/Geography/Azeatsane.html">Azeatsane</a>. It was placed there by the Spear-Guider <a href="/Left Menu/Prewar History/Legendary Figures/Kyosiibu Tsen.html">Kyosiibu Tsen</a> as part of her <a href="/Left Menu/Prewar History/Day of Blessing.html">gift</a> to humanity: a font of demonic power as corrupting as it was potent. Kyosiibu Tsen would act as mediary, taking and alloting the power of the Black Maple to those pious enough, greatly strengthening their spearmanship. However, those that sat under the Black Maple without her benediction quickly met a particular insanity, marked by the intense desire to take as many leaves as possible and distribute their influence to others--which, in turn, would expose them to the madness. It was so overpowering that agents of the Black Maple would forsake all earthly desires, dying quickly after their frenzied zealotry. Only <a href="/Left Menu/Prewar History/Historical Figures/Kurake.html">Kurake Razeatsaiko</a> has been known to be able to weather the gnawing effect and harness its power for his own ends.</p>

<p margin="50">CENTIPEDE TREES<br>They don't literally grow centipedes, but it looks like it thanks to the extreme symbiosis between Centipede Trees and colonies of centipedes which live in hollows grown specifically to house them. Their pincers secrete a strong acid which they use to hunt food and destroy the roots of all nearby plants, giving their host tree uncontested access to light and nutrients. Rarely, when a critical mass of centipedes is reached, they will turn on their tree, which disintegrates in a matter of minutes. It is theorized, and has been claimed by Kurake Razeatsaiko, that the Black Maple hosts a particularly deadly breed of centipedes, fluent in <a href="/Left Menu/Souls/Soul Expression.html">soul expression</a>. Tree centipedes are known to have minor regenerative capabilities, indicating the presence of souls, but there are no records of them ever expressing.</p>

<p margin="50">TAKE<br>There are roughly three types: Take patches, Take moss, and Take trees. All are reddish-brownish carnivorous plants which are extraordinarily nutrient-efficient but nearly incapable of storing any for future growth.<br>The parasitic patches spring up everywhere, and when any amount of blood manages to splash on it, a spike (of a size proportionate to the amount of blood consumed: usually half a meter for every 20 millileters) instantly protrudes from its center. Should the growth impale anything, which it usually does, it will continue to grow rapidly, as the corpse loses more and more blood. Human-fed Take patches can reach incredible heights, but, when the blood runs out, the patches become brittle, often breaking a few hours later. It has been harnessed for use in weaponry, with Living Shields constructed for use in the Battle of XXXX.<br>Take moss has similar properties, and is used for medicinal purposes; clumps of the stuff can be applied to a wound in order to stem its flow. However, the process of removing it is a delicate one, which may result in a worse wound than before.<br>Take trees grow exclusively in the very north of Terane, where the blood spilled as Kurake made his last stand combined with the still-festering beached <a href="/Left Menu/Prewar History/Legendary Figures/Whales.html">Maban</a> formed a blood table underneath the water table. They are also known as stonetrees, because they share many properties with petrified trees, but are, in fact, alive. Their exterior is hardened with a thick, rigid sap, so much so that Take bark is an adequate substitute for steel.</p>
