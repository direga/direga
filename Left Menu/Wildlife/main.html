<p margin="50">The flora and fauna of Terane, despite the small size of the island, are quite diverse. Their study was regarded as complete sometime around 300 years <a href="/Left Menu/Prewar History">PD</a>, but much has changed since then, and scholarship has not improved. People were interested in plants and animals (as far as they could prove useful to humanity, be it through medicinal, military, or magical use) but nowadays, nobody makes a career from novel discoveries. Instead, "<a href="/Left Menu/Modern History/Modern Science">research</a>" has turned to improving the efficiency of already-developed procedures for harvesting and implementing the power of the wild.</p>

<p margin="50">Terane is small, and so it is not unlikely that any plant or animal could be found anywhere. However, there are definite trends in certain areas, arisen usually not through climate but through chance. As a general rule, more mundane beings tend to localize, where beings with some degree of capacity for <a href="/Left Menu/Souls">soul expression</a> are less predictable. In addition, certain useful beings have been thoroughly domesticated, effectively extinguishing any wild presence they may have.</p><br>
